Now we are going to install bioconductor packages that we will use during the differential expression portion of the analysis.

```> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")```
You will get this message:
```
Warning in install.packages("BiocInstaller", repos = a["BioCsoft", "URL"]) :

```
Would you like to create a personal library

```
```> biocLite('phyloseq')```
```> install.packages("ape", dependencies = T)```
```> install.packages("vegan", dependencies = T)```
```> install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = T)```
```> install.packages("picante", dependencies = T)```
