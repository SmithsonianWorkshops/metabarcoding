Installation of QIIME 2.0 on a Mac OSX
Sept 2017

followed instructions at https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.8/install/native/#install-miniconda

Step 1: Install Miniconda

Download Python 2.7 64-bit (bash installer) to Downloads from:
https://conda.io/miniconda.html

Open terminal and type bash in your terminal window

And then pull the shell script into the terminal window, this will copy the path to the installer shell script

Or write:

bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda2-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

Hit enter to review license terms, scroll through them, say yes

Installer prompts you for install location, they recommend to accept default install location - Hit Enter
Installer prompts you about path, they recommend 'yes'

CLOSE and open terminal window for installation to take effect

In new terminal window, make sure you're running latest version, write:

conda update conda

Proceed --> y 



Step 2: Install QIIME

conda create -n qiime2-2017.8 --file https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2017.8-conda-osx-64.txt

There are a lot of dependencies, it took awhile to download all of them

SEE QIIME 2.0 instructions if you receive errors such as gfortan errors: https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.8/install/native/#install-miniconda


Step 3: Activate and test QIIME 2 environment

To use wget in QIIME tutorials, I had to download Homebrew 

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

And then run:

brew install wget
